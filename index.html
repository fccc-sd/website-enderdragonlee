            I have my twin brother Michael who plays the trombone, and we will some times work on our codes for are bolts together. We have a sister named Melissa who is
            two years younger than us who plays the clarinet in band. We have three dogs and their names are Addison, Dash, and Shadow. My dad played the trombone when he
            was in band, and now michael plays his trombone. our Mom played the flute in band witch is currently in Melissa's room. Our parents were both in the air force
            and after high school I am thinking about join the codeing side of the millitary.
